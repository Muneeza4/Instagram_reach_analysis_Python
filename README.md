Instagram Engagement Analysis


Overview

This project outlines the manner in which the interactions with posts and the raw impressions received or given are defined on the Instagram platform. 
Computer Science is also used to involve data analytics, statistic and data mining to acquire information concerning the features that impact post performance.



Data Sources
The metrics that are encompassed hereby comprise impressions that accompany the likes, comments, shares, saves, profile visits, follows and the captions and hashtags as well.



Key Steps and Analysis
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Measure of central tendency, measures of dispersion and missing value’s frequency, Mean, median, mode, case of missing data, Mean, standard deviations and 
info-gathering about excess within inferences, Box plots and IQR.




Visualizations:

Pie chart depicting the impression that has been made based on the sources.
This situation called for the strip plot of the engagement level computed on such parameters as:
Word clouds of the categorized captions and hashtags.
A coordinated line graph that is used to present the profile visit and the followers gained.
The Correlation bar plot based on impression-related variables of the main variables is below.
The date data X is represented by the following boxplots: before and after the outliers’ removal.



Machine Learning Model:

By using the Linear Regression model to predict the impressions which can be attained given the engagement rates.
Evaluation metrics: Mean squared error (MSE) normalized MSE all of which have been discussed earlier in the section also the R2 score.
One should now plot the Actual impressions and plot the Predicted plot alongside the Actual plot to be able to compare between the two.



Conclusion
The major objective of the given project implies providing effective recommendations about how the interaction with the audience on Instagram can be improved, 
as well as, defining factors that are influential when receiving the number of impressions to the posts.
Demonstrate how the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Scikit-learn libraries can be used in the processing and analysis of data and creating models.
